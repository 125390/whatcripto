# WhatCripto

Search and Destroy for ciphers. **Now in C# s2**

## Using

For now, I don't make all classes for decipher, so...you need
[`dotnet`](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started-with-dotnet-tutorial). Run with:

```bash
dotnet run <ARGUMENTS>
```

## ToDo

- Generate all bins for Windows, Linux, MacOS
- Help menu
- Document for classes and functions
- Fix bug of especial chars in some conversions
- Add more deciphers
